Echo Quadrato ,79,"Echo' Quadrato is a popular among both the ladies and the lads, as its streamlined exterior means it has no problem getting up to speed from a cold start.

Bavaria M5 ,80,"Class B racers whose budget can't stretch to a Colina Tanprice could do much worse than a Bavaria M5. The fastest 4-door saloon of its type, the M5 model has a top speed of 186mph, but it will take some time to get there due to its subpar acceleration ability.",Car,$0 ,"$43,000 ","$43,227 ","89,170"
Bavaria Z8 ,81,"The Bavaria Z8's rear wheel drive means it can often struggle for grip off the line, so if you're heading to a drag race you'll probably want something a little more reactive.

Chevalier CZ06 ,82,"Like most American cars, Chevalier's CZ06 doesn't handle particularly well.

Dart Rampager ,83,"An all-American icon, the Dart Rampager is as fast as it is chaotic, with this vehicle treating corners as a suggestion rather than a guide.

Knight Firebrand ,84,"Weak cornering caused by severe understeer means that the Knight Firebrand relies heavily on its straight line speed in order to remain competitive.

Invader H3 ,86,"This civilian version of a military favorite works fantastically on the dirt thanks to its superb braking ability, making it a fine, albeit slower Class D alternative to the Bavaria X5.

Echo S4 ,87,"The Echo S4's superb braking ability allows it to really dig in on the corners, making for a great exit speed once the turbos kick in.

Edomondo ACD ,89,"Edomondos are often blessed with great handling, and the ACD is no exception thanks to its wide wheelbase and stiff suspension springs. The car's weight is its biggest downfall, however, and this drags back the ACD's top speed to make it a mid-range option among Class D cars.",Car,$0 ,"$23,000 ","$22,278 ","1,646,380"
Edomondo Localé ,90,"The Edomondo Localé is popular among those new to racing due to its recommendation in Baldr's racing guide.

Verpestung Insecta ,91,"Described as one of the few good things to come out of WWII, the Verpestung Insecta's limited top speed may put some consumers off this cheap and cheerful vehicle.

Chevalier CVR ,92,"Like most American cars, the Chevalier CVR simply cannot take a corner, so you're limited as to what you can achieve with this vehicle.

Volt MNG ,93,"Volt's MNG is an iconic car for one reason and one reason alone - it is literally unstoppable. Its combination of an extreme top speed and brakes made of sponge means you're just as likely to see the back of an ambulance as you are the chequered flag when driving this thing. Baldr's guide considers the MNG to be one of the best Class B cars around, but those in the Torn City hospital refer to their drivers as organ donors.",Car,"$38,000 ","$17,000 ","$19,989 ","152,896"
Trident ,94,"As you might expect from a three wheeler, the Trident isn't much in terms of pace, and is actually one of the slowest cars available in Torn City.

Oceania SS ,95,"Pacy but poor out of the blocks is an apt description of the Oceania SS - but hey, it works for Usain Bolt!

Limoen Saxon ,494,"The Limoen Saxon is mightily quick off the line, and actually has the joint-best acceleration rating of any Class E car along with the Çagoutte 10-6.

Nano Pioneer ,495,"Nano drivers tend to fall into one of two categories. Either they're lifelong fans of this classic British brand, or they're too cheap to pay for gas. If you ever see the Nano Pioneer overtake you on the track you're in trouble, as this is one of the slowest cars available in Torn City. But that's actually a bonus in some ways, as the Nano's 8 inch braking discs couldn't stop a snail if it were mooching.",Car,"$9,500 ","$7,500 ","$10,391 ","152,533"
Vita Bravo ,496,"The Vita Bravo is a solid investment for Class E drivers as despite its relatively poor top end speed it remains competitive when pitted against Class D vehicles.

Zaibatsu Macro ,497,"Most people only ever find themselves in the seat of a Zaibatsu Macro when they're taking their driving test, and with good reason. The Macro handling is abysmal, and this would be dangerous if it could ever reach anything beyond a mid-range top speed. That being said, the braking on these vehicles is absolutely first class, which is probably a good thing if you've got a GTA-addicted teenager in the driving seat.",Car,$0 ,"$7,500 ","$263,180 ","52,833"
Çagoutte 10-6 ,498,"This French hot hatch is popular in its class due to its rapid acceleration, and unlike the Limoen Saxon, this car has the pace to make use of it. If you're looking to purchase a Çagoutte 10-6, your best bet is to try the nearest wreck yard, or perhaps a large tree on a shaded corner, since this car's brakes appear to be made of cotton candy.",Car,"$8,000 ","$6,500 ","$7,686 ","133,294"
Papani Colé ,499,"Papani's Colé model is a great choice for Class E drivers who need pace over precision.

Bedford Racer ,500,"A favorite among everyone's girlfriend during the early 2000's, the Bedford Racer is a safe little motor whose brakes are far and away its most impressive asset.

Stålhög 860 ,501,"Stålhög's USP lies in the sturdiness and strength of their cars. The 860 is no different, with this battleship weighing in at a colossal two tonnes.

Alpha Milano 156 ,502,"Alpha Milano's 156 model possesses a large amount of torque, giving it great acceleration off the line.

Bavaria X5 ,503,"Handling is not the X5's strong point, with one online review describing it as ""sharp as a tug boat on tarmac.""

Coche Basurero ,504,"The Coche Basurero is something of a joke in Torn, since you're far more likely to see it at the dump than on the road.

Bedford Nova ,505,"With a top speed of 150mph the Bedford Nova is the fastest in its class by some margin.

Verpestung Sport ,506,"Either of the Verpestungs available in Torn will serve you well in a D-class dirt race, but as its name suggests, the Sport is slightly quicker than the Insecta, albeit by a paltry 2mph. When it comes to the tarmac, Torn's racers find that this king of the hot hatches is often beaten by the Insecta at all but a handful of tracks.",Car,"$12,500 ","$7,300 ","$10,384 ","59,432"
Echo S3 ,507,"The Echo S3 is considered an elite car among Class C vehicles, with their limited top speed compensated for by strong acceleration.

Volt RS ,508,"The Volt RS's top speed of 163mph makes it only the third-fastest in Class C, but where it stands alone is the rapid acceleration provided by its 300bhp, 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

Edomondo S2 ,509,"The wise racer never takes the Edomondo S2 straight from the showroom to the track. Fresh out of the box, this Class C car is distinctly average in terms of speed and handling, and its superior braking ability doesn't quite make up for its shortfalls. However, once you've applied a few upgrades to this baby, the s2 comes much more competitive - if you choose wisely, that is.",Car,"$40,000 ","$21,000 ","$28,724 ","41,088"
Nano Cavalier ,510,"The Nano Cavalier may be at the lower end of class C in terms of sheer pace, but its speed off the line makes it a force to be reckoned with on the right track. Thankfully, the Cavalier comes outfitted with a better set of brakes than the Nano Pioneer, although it doesn't quite have the relative handling advantage among similar cars of its class.",Car,$0 ,"$27,000 ","$190,493 ","21,908"
Colina Tanprice ,511,"If you're heading to a dirt track, a fully upgraded Colina Tanprice will often outpace even the most well-equipped Class A car.

Cosmos EX ,512,"Take a Cosmos EX out on the straight and your opponents will leave you for dust, as its tiny 1.8 liter engine means it simply cannot compete against other Class B cars when speed is the deciding factor.

Yotsuhada EVX ,513,"The Yotsuhada EVX may not fare too well on the tarmac, but this model is well suited to off-road and rally tracks.

Sturmfahrt 111 ,514,"You can't get more iconic than the Sturmfahrt, but image isn't everything. On the right track, this lightweight racer is competitive enough, but the triple one's top speed is seriously hindered by downforce.

Tsubasa Impressor ,515,"Tsubasa's Impressor offers an outstanding alternative to the expensive Colina Tanprice for those heading to a dirt track. The Impressor beats the Tanprice in terms of speed and acceleration, but is let down by its relatively poor handling. Nevertheless, this car's status as a rally legend makes it more than competitive out in the mud.",Car,"$55,000 ","$28,000 ","$52,995 ","54,101"
Wington GGU ,516,"The Wington GGU is frustratingly close to being an excellent ride. If this car could brake as well as it handles, it'd be up there with the very best.

Weston Marlin 177 ,517,"The Weston Marlin brand may be the preserve of well-heeled international super-spies, but their build and design quality impresses petrol-heads too. The 177 model is considered a great alternative to the Veloria or Edomondo as a Class A starter car, but its 700bhp V12 engine means that practice is needed if you are to make the most of this car's ability around corners.",Car,$0 ,"$2,100,000 ","$2,144,998 ","28,768"

Stormatti Casteon ,519,"Considered the pinnacle of engineering perfection, the Casteon's quad-turbocharged W16 engine is capable of 0-60 in 2.5 seconds and a top speed of 254mph, making it the fastest car in Torn City by some margin. But don't let its straight line speed fool you, as while this vehicle's gigantic rear air brake does a reasonable job of slowing it down, the Casteon's poor handling means it is far from unbeatable on the vast majority of tracks.",Car,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,36
Lolo 458 ,520,"The Lolo 458 isn't the best car overall for any given track, but its versatility and competitive stats make it a good option for your first Class A purchase nonetheless.

Lambrini Torobravo ,521,"Torn's racing community is undecided as to whether the Lambrini or the Veloria is the best choice for Uptown, with the former holding higher acceleration and braking, but its rival possessing a better top speed.

Veloria LFA ,522,"As you might expect from the luxury vehicle division of its parent brand Tabata, the Veloria LFA is capable of incredible top speeds on the straight. But while this car can out-drag most of its class rivals, the LFA's weight causes great intertia when stopping, in spite of its excellent braking system. The LFA is still considered one of the top Class A cars, however, and is capable of posting All Class records on the right track.",Car,$0 ,"$4,700,000 ","$5,189,801 ","39,590"
Mercia SLR ,523,"Mercia's SLR isn't a popular choice among Class A drivers, with its difficult handling meaning it tends to be saved for long ratio tracks such as Convict or Withdrawal.

At the time this description was written, such a prospect seems increasingly likely, as BambinaDuckie appears to be stepping away from Torn.

Becoming the first person to perform this job full time, bogie transformed Torn by clamping down on its most toxic elements. Having earned more karma than anyone in Torn history, he’s learned one vital truth: arguing with idiots is pointless—a lesson he took to heart after winning the UK game show of the same name, where his prize was a wet kiss from Richard Osman, the only man tall enough to reach.

D3vl's Keepsake ,1395,"They say it's better the devil you know, but in this case, you'd rather not! A hostile individual with a bad word for everyone, d3vl’s abrasive personality once led the game’s founder to openly admit he’d be relieved to see him leave. Yet, despite countless promises to quit, d3vl lingers in Torn like a fart in an elevator, much to the dismay of the developers who’ve been promised a day off when he finally leaves. In-game, he’s notorious for leading factions to great heights—only to pocket most of the rewards himself. We’re certain d3vl will have issues with this description, though truth be told, this is a man who could argue with his own reflection, even if it was trying its best to agree with him.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
MarlonBrando's Keepsake ,1396,"If nonsensical rambling were an art form, MarlonBrando would be prime Picasso. The undisputed king of waffle, Marlon is known more for his baffling forum presence than any in-game achievements. His signature style includes spamming gifs, endless poll options, and memes so bad they make you regret developing eyes. And yet, despite never posting anything of value, there's something oddly endearing about his unwavering commitment to this most unproductive of pastimes.

Champion's Keepsake ,1397,"Feted by forum-dwellers, Champion is a prime example of what might happen if we let overmedicated twelve-year-olds play Torn. Long known for talking a better game than he plays, his massive stash of karma is a testament to Champ's talent for promotion, and this surely played a part in his impressive rise to the Monarch leadership team. In his early days, Champion infamously wielded a Gold AK despite having under 1 million battle stats—a situation akin to handing nuclear codes to a chimpanzee. He’s also the only person to have two Tornographies written about him, having infiltrated Z_junior's biography by posing as ""Junia's"" biggest fan.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Sweeney_Todd's Keepsake ,1398,"Being listed as a reprobate suggests that Sweeney_Todd has taken a path darker than the Victorian cutthroat after which he's named. However, his only real crime is a cranky, dismissive forum presence, with posts easily identified by his overuse of ellipses and the notorious barfing face emoji. A true veteran, Sweeney_Todd joined Torn in March 2005, just a year after its inception, later becoming one of the core admin team. Nearly a third of his time here has been spent in his faction, The Pearl—formerly The Pie Shop—where he is often the only member, for reasons we can but presume. Let’s face it, Sweeney isn’t likely to ever leave this city until Chedburn unplugs the server; long after others have quit, the surly one will remain, shouting into the wind.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
YoungBlaze's Keepsake ,1399,"YoungBlaze’s genius lay in his ability to pull off the most underhanded, despicable scams—all while staying within Torn's rules, forcing the developers to implement changes to protect its citizens. Widely regarded as one of the city's first career scumbags, our modern con artists owe him a great debt, as they are still profiting from the very schemes he pioneered. It might seem like poetic justice for a scammer to have his own tactics stolen without credit, but the concept of justice hardly applies to someone like Blaze—especially since he vanished one day without ever returning the billions he swindled.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
IceColdCola's Keepsake ,1400,"IceColdCola is a rarity among reprobates, as he's actually recognized for his in-game achievements. Granted, those 'achievements' involve ripping off Torn's new players, but this is a crime game, after all! Cola's signature scam is the Vicoxan trick and its variations, where cheap items like Vicodin are sold at Xanax prices, hoping distracted buyers won't notice the difference. This tactic has earned ICC over 1,500 enemies, making him one of the most disliked players in Torn. He’s even gone so far as to block legitimate customers, including Torn's NPCs, from buying from his bazaar, ensuring there are always plenty of overpriced grenades, Vicodin, and mistletoe to go around—at an inflated price, of course.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Z_junior's Keepsake ,1401,"One of the greatest war leaders this city has seen, Z_junior was arguably its most powerful citizen for a time, leading JFK to dominate the faction landscape during Torn's formative years. The tides of warfare may have turned since his glory days, but ""Junia"" remains an influential figure, with those close to him citing his wisdom and authority as the main reasons for his success.

BodyBagger's Keepsake ,1402,"The first player to reach level 100, and the only to hit 102 before being reverted, BodyBagger was Torn's undisputed strongest for many years. Some would argue he still is, only surpassed by those who have obsessively honed a single battle stat. So powerful was BB in his prime that he dominated even the legendary NPC Duke, using him as his personal ATM—until the rotund mafioso had his pockets sewn shut for protection. Yet, despite his fearsome reputation, BodyBagger's strength came from a decent place, driven by a desire to resist the bullying of an older player, Nota.

King_Ace's Keepsake ,1403,"Back in the day, King_Ace was the closest Torn had to royalty, with his power matched only by his notorious ego. Better known these days as a leveling target, KA, also known as The_Legend, was one of the early game's strongmen, with forum scholars listing him as a founder of the 39th Street family.

Despite his generosity, he continues to dominate numerous Hall of Fame categories, including respect earned, attacks made, and many other impressive metrics.

RGiskard's Keepsake ,1405,"A leader by example, respected by both factionmates and foes, RGiskard was a stabilizing force in Relentless during turbulent times and a founding member of its successor, Monarch. His calm under pressure earned him the trust to lead wartime tactics and manage investment funds, cementing his well-rounded reputation. However, he is mightily unbalanced in one area—his battle stats. As the first to reach 1 quadrillion in strength, one player described him as 'half algorithm, half deity,' a title that perfectly matches his namesake, Giskard—the robot from Isaac Asimov's works who could read and influence minds, perhaps hinting at the true source of RGiskard's relentless success.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Hank's Keepsake ,1406,"Hank's journey is unmatched in drama, success, and influence. A key figure in the evolution of Calculating into Relentless and then Monarch, he was the heart and soul of Torn's strongest faction family. His keen eye for patterns and stats helped countless new players with his power-leveling guide, but the WSSB scandal saw Hank's name tainted, unfairly, according to some, when his alleged use of a casino exploit resulted in a $136 billion fine. Feeling betrayed by Torn and its community, Hank nearly walked away but now keeps a lower profile—unlike his crotch, which stands proud in his profile picture and is immortalized in his keepsake, the banana hammock.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
HT-Supermikk's Keepsake ,1407,"In an alternate timeline, HT-Supermikk was the first to reach level 100, narrowly missing out before his status was stripped by the authorities for using slutting methods. Mikk has faced plenty of setbacks in Torn, from losing his entire fortune early on to enduring the indignity of co-leading a faction with d3vl. Yet his achievements speak for themselves, particularly his mass of awards—at one point, he ranked in the top 5 across 10 Hall of Fame categories and managed to acquire every item in Torn. A founding member of the recently resurrected Hat Trick family, which once dominated Torn as a Norwegian-only faction, Mikk has told his wife many times that he's quit this 'stupid game,' but it is to Torn's benefit that he continues to lie to his spouse.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
someone's Keepsake ,1408,"A pioneer of the level-holding playstyle, someone stayed at level 1 for her entire Torn life. Her low status belied her impressive battle stats, allowing someone to rack up enough defends to keep her in the all-time top ten as of 2024, despite not playing for a decade. But holding a low level came at a cost—her stats were eventually reduced by 99% due to her inability to fly and rehabilitate. Her profile was also often plastered with bounties, many likely due to being wrongly blamed for others' stealth attacks. In the end, the player with the most generic name and founder of the Nameless faction suffered an ironic fate, as she was fedded for having multiple identities.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
CockyNudist's Keepsake ,1409,"CockyNudist is the opposite of a level holder, having somehow reached Level 100 with the lowest battle stats imaginable. At one point, he even had a negative speed stat due to an addiction bug, a situation he famously worsened by using a skateboard—much to the community’s amusement. As of 2024, this remains the only SE CockyNudist has ever used, and he continues to stubbornly refuse to set foot in a gymnasium. Despite his unique approach, he manages to get by quite well, though his lack of stats costs him dearly in ammunition—a fact reflected by his status as the player with the most rounds fired in Torn history.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Rosie's Keepsake ,1410,"Political assassinations are tough to pull off, even with a team of seasoned criminals. But Rosie flipped the difficulty to hardcore mode by deliberately recruiting greenleaf players with low nerve bars to join her mission. Yet still, she succeeded, becoming the first to achieve this incredible feat thanks to her own extensive crime experience. A legendary buster and lawbreaker, Rosie is said to have written the book on criminality, having pushed Torn's mechanics so far that the developers were forced to intervene—you know you’re a true pioneer when others have to fix the things you’ve broken.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Data's Keepsake ,1411,"Racing in Torn is a niche pastime, but for those who pursue it, it's serious business—none more so than for Data, who in 2022 became the first player to reach the maximum 100 Racing Skill. Data's dedication to high-octane action has earned him numerous titles in community-run championships, with his name etched across many tracks where he holds records. Impressively, he's done all of this without Torn's fastest car, a prize reserved for URT winners.

Astral's Keepsake ,1412,"Even if you don’t know Astral’s name, you’re almost certainly familiar with his artwork. Astral was a driving force behind the graphics forums during their heyday, with an influence that extended far beyond his own incredible signatures, and his wallpapers having graced the Torn City Times freebies page for years. Alongside House MD, he hosted the Graphics Aid website, where community-designed graphics were auctioned off, earning their creators billions in in-game revenue. Few would think to invest such effort and creativity into images for a text-based game, but Astral did—and many have followed in his footsteps, elevating Torn’s visuals and proving there are ways to earn money beyond traditional mechanics.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Stormcast's Keepsake ,1413,"Players like Stormcast are the reason racing is so popular in Torn today. An early enthusiast of the raceway, he authored guides, broke records, and claimed numerous titles. His crowning achievement came when he won the first-ever Ultimate Racing Tournament, then known as the PRC. His prize was a rare Bugatti Veyron, Torn’s fastest car, since renamed in his honor as the Stormatti Casteon. Described as a larger-than-life figure, Stormcast's passing was commemorated by the community with a tournament organized by the Night Racers and a special 1,000-driver tribute race at the end of the following URT. Such gestures are only reserved for the best, a mark of the respect Stormcast earned both on and off the track.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
JamilB's Keepsake ,1414,"On March 3rd, 2008, Torn's citizens cowered in fear as a nuclear device was detonated for the very first time. The man responsible was JamilB, who unleashed a Dirty Bomb on Devastation, the bitter rivals of his own faction, Hells Angels. This cataclysmic attack, which cost a fortune in cash and cesium, tore 10,321 respect from the enemy faction and forever changed the landscape of Torn. Though a retaliatory bomb soon followed, the damage was done. The floodgates had opened, and many more strikes would ravage our city in the years to come—but none left a mark quite like the first.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Kivou's Keepsake ,1415,"Whether you've spent the day trading, chaining, or chasing awards, you likely have Kivou to thank for your success. As the creator of the popular YATA website, Kivou has improved the Torn experience for countless players, directing their efforts with a wealth of data at their fingertips. Faction and company owners likely owe him trillions thanks to the efficiency gains achieved through YATA's array of tools. And for anyone frustrated by Jimmy being taken down at loot level III, the NPC timing feature is a godsend. Kivou describes himself as an explorer, creating YATA as a way to uncover new insights.

DeKleineKobini's Keepsake ,1416,"DeKleineKobini is one of the game’s great collaborators, working with countless developers to create a range of tools that augment and improve Torn’s features. He’s perhaps best known for his work on TornTools, where he took over from its creator, Mephiles, and shaped it into the essential extension it is today. So, next time you use TT to block the latest DUDE wannabe on the forums, you’ll know who to thank. Beyond TornTools, DKK has built numerous scripts on his own and contributed extensively to the community's understanding of the API, paving the way for others to build and innovate just as he has.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
IceBlueFire's Keepsake ,1417,"It’s safe to say that IceBlueFire is the most influential external developer Torn has ever known. His three-digit ID tells you just how long he’s been here, and for a time, he even served us in an official capacity—until the experience of looking under the hood proved too traumatic. Yet as an external developer, IBF’s impact is unmatched: he helped create Torn’s API, paving the way for Torn’s future army of mug-scripters. He later founded TornStats, the first public tool of its kind, and also became Torn’s longest-serving staff member. Despite his vast knowledge of Torn, he is known for never making people feel stupid when asking questions, even if those questions are extremely stupid.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Mauk's Keepsake ,1418,"In the early days of scripting, Mauk’s DoctorN extension dominated the scene, becoming an essential tool for any serious player. So comprehensive was this extension that it even led to the retirement of City Watch, an official downloadable program you could purchase for points. Mauk's work transformed how players interacted with Torn, encouraging even passive players to adopt a more aggressive, results-driven playstyle. Though Mauk’s departure has left DoctorN obsolete, the impact he made on our city continues to shape every new meta and development.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Mephiles' Keepsake ,1419,"TornTools quickly became the most popular extension upon its creation by Mephiles, offering a wealth of features that provided players with new functions, data, and quality-of-life improvements to ease Torn’s more repetitive tasks. But perhaps the most crucial decision Mephiles made was to keep TornTools open source, allowing others to build upon his work even in his absence. This collaborative spirit lives on, with numerous developers stepping in to apply updates—transforming TornTools into a 'Frankentool' that continues to evolve with the community’s needs.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Manuito's Keepsake ,1420,"Torn’s growing audience of mobile players owes much to Manuito’s crucial contributions. As the architect of TornPDA, he filled a gap for iOS users who lacked access to Torn’s official app, enabling tens of thousands to enjoy Torn on their devices. His work impressed the developers so much that TornPDA received official endorsement, and he was later hired to create Torn Lite.

Ara's Keepsake ,1421,"Most know Ara as the charismatic voice of Torn Underground, Torn's top podcast, co-created with TheFelan. With the warmth and authenticity of an old-school radio host, his presenting style captivates listeners—though his dramatic Torn story could be an episode of its own. Ara's current account is a restart after his original was fedded for real money trading. Since then, he's kept his nose clean, climbing into Torn's top 100 players (ask him about his strength). With a history on both sides of the law, Ara tells the story of our city like no one else.

Body's Keepsake ,1422,"It is often said that Torn is a social network with a game attached, and few have done more to steer us in that direction than Body. An early community figurehead, Body was a pioneer of player-driven events. Her Big Brother event challenged participants with questions and tasks, including the iconic dollar sale, now a fixture on Torn’s calendar. She was also a regular presence on Torn Radio and Torn IRC, running countless giveaways. Later, Body became a Torn secretary, as officers were known back then, and her esteemed status was demonstrated when she was busted out of jail by Chedburn himself. Few are as deserving of such recognition, but nobody can deny that Body truly earned it.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
aurigus' Keepsake ,1423,"Navigating a new city is hard without a guide, and aurigus was one of the best Torn has ever known. His website, Torn City Basic, gathered every scrap of information a player could need, complete with a Q&A section for more specific questions. TCbasic was so comprehensive that much of its content later formed the basis for the Torn Wiki. Though it has since become outdated and gone offline, TCbasic was once an essential roadmap, helping newcomers find their way through Torn's dangerous streets. Without aurigus's vast knowledge and knack for delivering it, our population might be a fraction of what it is today, as his guidance kept countless players on course when they might otherwise have given up.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Quacks' Keepsake ,1424,"A mysterious figure in Torn lore, the holder of ID [2] has long intrigued the community, fueling speculation about Quacks’ role in the city's origins. Described as instrumental by Chedburn himself, Quacks assisted our founder in establishing Torn, teaching him the basics of web development and helping him to program many of the game’s early features. If Chedburn was the architect, then Quacks was the builder—while not involved in design, he helped turn Ched’s ideas into reality, laying the foundations that have supported Torn for nearly two decades. In 2008, Quacks vanished, having gradually stepped back from his contributions to our corner of the internet. Yet, Torn’s continued existence after all these years stands as a testament to the role he played.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Aethwynn's Keepsake ,1425,"Aethwynn, known as Wynn, is considered Torn's first Community Manager, having led staff during the game's Wild West era. In a time when players pushed every boundary, Wynn reined them in, earning respect for her friendly, forgiving approach. Sadly, her generosity may have been her downfall; she lost her position after a scandal involving her spouse, Locked, a fellow admin who gifted himself stats and items. Perhaps that’s why she's the only staffer with two collectibles to her name. Community Managers have since become more formal authorities, and while we may never see another cat-obsessed, risqué CM like Wynn, we’ll always remember she was the first to bring our city of drug-addicted miscreants to heel.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
-Clansdancer's Keepsake ,1426,"-Clansdancer's time as Community Manager saw Torn shift from a haven of outlaws to a more disciplined city. Strict but fair, even Torn's scoundrels respected Clansy's authority, as she was careful never to prejudge those with notorious reputations. Her zero-tolerance for nonsense extended to staff, keeping them on a tight leash and preventing abuses of power that had occurred in the past. -Clansdancer also made history as the first to complete a Political Assassination alongside Chedburn, with her stats tweaked to prove this organized crime could actually be completed. Her love of pink and ever-present flip-flops are immortalized in her keepsake—just be grateful you’ll never feel the sting of one aimed your way.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
LeukyBear's Keepsake ,1427,"LeukyBear’s unique approach to Torn set him apart from the beginning. An early adopter of the drug-free lifestyle, he focused intensely on defense, becoming one of the first players to ""whore"" a single stat. His rigorous SSL training relied on boosters, with cost no obstacle for someone who was once our wealthiest player. Leuky also had a taste for luxury residences—at one point, he was the sole owner of a palace and later acquired Trekant Tower, one of our twelve unique properties. As an admin, Leuky had a nose for uncovering corruption, though some questioned his motives after the well-timed takedown of the infamous Tea, whose fedding took a quarter of the economy with him. Maybe we’ll take a page from his playbook the next time Torn faces another bout of inflation.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
is0lati0n's Keepsake ,1428,"Described as a big ol' teddy bear with a thing for little people, is0lati0n was a key member of Chedburn's support team during Torn's crucial first few years. A skilled programmer, he helped create the original racing feature in the days before we enjoyed such luxuries as watching dots move around a 2D track. Is0 was also a trusted staff member, often called upon for impartial investigations—most notably during the infamous fedding of Tea by LeukyBear. Yet, is0lati0n's own reputation wasn’t exactly squeaky clean, as suggested by his staff item, the Brutus Key Chain. The real-life reference behind this item might be too risqué for a PG-13 game… oh, who are we kidding? It was a home-made dildo.",Collectible,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Zip Ties ,1429,"Made from durable nylon, zip ties are the favored bonding apparatus of both hostage takers and electricians, with these lockable plastic strips able to clasp wrists and wires together in a pinch.

Shaped Charge ,1430,"When a standard explosion just won't cut it, the shaped charge can be deployed to deliver focused devastation. This device works by channeling its blast energy into a concentrated point using a metal liner—typically made of copper—enabling you to target the weak spots of armored vehicles, reinforced doors, or your cute cousin's chastity belt. Just make sure you're outside of the blast radius when this thing goes off, otherwise, you'll have a neat circular hole where your face used to be.",Material,$0 ,"$2,400 ","$302,439 ","51,541"
Core Drill ,1431,"The Core Drill is the heavy-duty solution for penetrating the toughest materials. This powerful apparatus is engineered to bore through concrete, bedrock and, if you believe the rumors, Superman's bones. Equipped with a high-torque motor and a diamond-tipped drill bit, it cuts through virtually anything with relentless efficiency. However, the downside is the time needed to bolt its stabilization rig into the ground. If you're using a Core Drill to bust into somewhere you're not supposed to be, like a bank or an orphanage, dismantling it in a hurry isn't an option, so don't be surprised if you have to leave it behind.",Tool,$0 ,"$80,000 ","$497,831 ","48,968"

Devil Horns ,1450,"In medieval art, devil horns symbolized the bestial nature of the dark lord Lucifer and his demonic brethren, with these bony protrusions used to distinguish evil-doers from more benevolent, hornless beings like angels, humans, or puppies.

You do now, and you can tell people this fact while sporting a realistic mask of his 11-year-old face as seen in the 1990 family comedy, Home Alone. Macauley would go on to make this face repeatedly when confronted with such horrors as a nude Michael Jackson approaching him in the shower, or a nude Michael Jackson cuddling up to him in bed. But nobody has to see a nude Michael Jackson anymore, because he's dead, thus restoring Macauley Culkin's childhood innocence forevermore.",Clothing,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,250
Oversized Christmas Sweater ,1453,"The concept of an oversized sweatshirt is something of a philosophical conundrum. How can a sweatshirt be ""oversized"" if it was made to exact specifications? For whom is this product ""oversized"" exactly? Any sweatshirt could be oversized if worn by a small enough person. Does an adult sweatshirt become oversized when placed over the truncated torso of Warwick Davis? Is a regular-sized sweatshirt undersized if James Corden has forced his sausagey frame inside it? Perhaps this is one of the great mysteries of the universe we'll never truly solve. Or, it's just a generic term for a ruddy massive jumper.",Clothing,$0 ,$0 ,$0 ,"1,000"

After tipping a few down your gullet, you’ll be adventurous enough to throw marshmallows to gators in the swamp or run through the French Quarter in a red dress. Unfortunately, no amount of alcohol from this glass will save you from PrincessJulie’s swing with a giant inflatable bonk bat or inspire the level of confidence it took Sealion to hug Chedburn in a tiny red thong poolside.

Bolas ,1456,"A throwing weapon used by South American hunters and warriors, bolas are designed to entangle a target and temporarily incapacitate them. After building momentum through several overhead swings, they can disable an enemy at range by tripping them, restricting movement, or breaking bones on impact. The word bolas, meaning ""balls"" in Spanish and Portuguese, refers to the weapon's primary feature, typically two or three stones or metal weights connected by cord. Regardless of their design, bolas should never be used as a substitute for Ben Wa balls—at least not without a thorough cleaning first.",Temporary,$0 ,$0 ,"$8,400,001 ",778
